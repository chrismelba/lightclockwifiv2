# The Light Clock

This is a project to create a clock out of an ESP8266 chip and a string of neopixel LEDs. The project was released on a successful [kickstarter!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1054187792/the-light-clock?token=00673970) in 2017

In this repo are compiled binaries for the latest two firmware patches, plus all the code if you wish to modify for your device

Instructions on building the light clock can be found on [instructables!](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Light-Clock-IoT/)
